# AI-Driven-Games-Blackjack-and-Memory-Card-Matching


## Introduction
This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Blackjack game. It includes AI players that use heuristic approaches, fuzzy logic, and alpha-beta pruning, creating an engaging and challenging experience for players.

## Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Play against AI agents and a dealer with realistic decision-making.
- **AI Strategies**:
  - Heuristic evaluation for probability-based decisions.
  - Fuzzy logic for nuanced risk assessment.
  - Alpha-beta pruning for optimized gameplay.
- **Interactive UI**: Built using Pygame for an intuitive user experience.
- **Scoring System**: Real-time updates for player, dealer, and AI scores.

## How to Play
1. Players and AI start with two cards.
2. Choose to "Hit" (draw a card) or "Stand" (keep your hand).
3. The goal is to reach a total score close to 21 without exceeding it.
